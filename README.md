## 💡 Key Features

### 1. High-Performance Ray Tracing (Intel Embree)
The legacy BSP-traversal ray caster has been replaced with the industry-standard **Intel Embree 4.4.0** BVH builder and intersection kernels.
- **Selective Shadowing:** Alpha-tested surfaces (foliage, grates) now cast accurate, per-pixel shadows via a custom `AlphaFilter` integration.
- **Unified Data Cache:** To maximize performance, the toolchain pre-calculates and caches the world-space origin and normal of every lightmap texel and volumetric voxel. This cached geometry is shared across all lighting stages (Direct, Radiosity, and Ambient), eliminating redundant coordinate reconstruction.
- **Intelligent Light Culling:** The tool uses an advanced culling system that calculates a light's physical "reach" based on energy intensity and a configurable `cutoff` threshold. This allows the ray tracer to ignore surfaces outside a light's influence radius with zero overhead.
- **Performance Gain:** The combination of Intel's highly optimized BVH kernels and our internal geometric caching results in a 10x performance gain during the ray tracing phase compared to traditional tools.

### 2. 32-bit Floating Point Pipeline
- **Internal Buffers:** All lighting data (luxels, light grid) is accumulated in float32 buffers to prevent rounding artifacts and light clipping.
- **Dynamic Normalization:** Final 8-bit output conversion is deferred allowing for superior tonemapping and highlight compression.

### 3. First-Class Model Support (misc_model)
`misc_model` entities are no longer second class citizens. They are fully integrated into the world geometry.
- **Automatic Collision (HACD):** Every model placed into the map is solid by default. Optimized convex collision hulls are automatically generated using the **HACD (Hierarchical Approximate Convex Decomposition)** algorithm.
- **Omnidirectional Lightmapping:** Triangle soups receive high-quality, seamless lightmaps. The UV-to-world rasterizer preserves the integrity of the mesh regardless of its topology.
- **Lightmapped by Default:** Unless explicitly disabled in the shader, all models are solid and lightmapped just like world brushes.

### 4. Brush-to-Light Generation (func_light)
The `func_light` entity allows mappers to create complex light setups directly from brush geometry without any shader scripting.
- **Surface & Spot Lights:** Any brush surface can be instantly turned into an emissive light source or a spotlight emitter.
- **Ease of Use:** Mappers can control light intensity, color, and attenuation directly via entity keys, making high-quality emissive lighting accessible without modifying assets.

### 5. In-Editor Configurable Surface Colors
Mappers can now tint and recolor materials directly within the map editor without having to author duplicate shader files (the shader must have been created for this purpose, tho).
- **Entity Level Tinting:** By applying the `vertexcolor` key to entities like `misc_model` or `func_group`, the compiler automatically overrides the vertex colors of all associated surfaces.
- **Workflow Efficiency:** This allows for rapid iteration and material reuse. For example, a single "car" model or "crate" brushwork group can be placed multiple times in a map, each tinted a different color exclusively via entity keys.

### 6. Automatic Light Halos
Spotlights and directed light sources can now automatically generate volumetric "halos" (billboards) to simulate atmospheric scattering.
- **Dynamic Sizing:** Halo dimensions are automatically calculated based on the light's intensity and radius, ensuring the visual effect matches the physical light cone.
- **Shader Control:** Mappers can override the default halo effect using the `haloshader` key or disable it entirely for specific lights.
- **Vertex Color Integration:** Halos inherit their color from the light source.

### 7. Modernized Color & Lighting Models
- **Global Color Pipeline:** A unified color parser supports floating-point RGB (0..1), integer RGB (0..255), and Hexadecimal codes (`#RRGGBB`).
- **Artistic Integrity:** The compiler no longer automatically normalizes light colors. This preserves the original brightness and "mood" intended by the mapper.
- **Advanced Shading Models:** Support for industry-standard attenuation models (Inverse-Square, Unreal, Smoothstep) and shading kernels (Half-Lambert, Quadratic).

### 8. Macro Ambient Occlusion (MAO)
A new volumetric ambient occlusion pass computes spatial "openness" for both the light grid and lightmaps.
- **Atmospheric Depth:** Large-scale features (caves, corridors, plazas) naturally darken or brighten based on their enclosure, grounding objects in the environment without requiring thousands of point lights.
- **Bent Normals:** Per-texel ambient energy includes a directional hint (Bent Normal), ensuring normal maps respond correctly to the primary direction of incoming ambient light.

### 9. High-Quality 2D Filtering
Post-process lightmap filtering has been rebuilt for maximum quality and seamlessness across geometry charts.
- **Stitch Filtering:** The toolchain automatically identifies adjacent surfaces sharing world-space edges (partners) and performs cross-surface bilinear sampling to eliminate visible seams.
- **Volumetric Filtering:** Specialized world-space filtering for complex "triangle soup" (models) ensures smooth lighting gradients even on meshes with disconnected UV islands.
- **Per-Surface Customization:** Mappers can override the global smoothing settings on a per-entity basis using the `smooth` key, allowing for sharper shadows on some objects and softer, more diffuse lighting on others.
- **GPU Acceleration:** All filtering and anti-aliasing passes are fully GPU-accelerated via OpenCL, allowing for high-quality multi-pass smoothing without significant compile-time penalties.

### 10. Deluxe Mapping V2
An improved, irradiance-preserving deluxe mapping system.
- **Iterative Accumulation:** Light directions are resolved during each contribution, preventing "rim bloom" artifacts[1] and ensuring stable directional highlights even in areas with opposing light sources.
- [1] It's not possible to fully eliminate them. They're part of the nature of deluxemapping, but they happen less often and the smooth filter can hide them when they happen.

### 11. Customizable Game Profiles (JSON)
Externalized game-specific configurations into customizable JSON profiles.
- **Engine Adaptability:** Mappers can easily define new profiles for different game engines, specifying unique BSP versions, lump counts, and hard limits (max verts/indexes).
- **Global Defaults:** Every lighting parameter—including default lightmap sizes, shading models, and attenuation curves—can be tuned per game profile to ensure consistent results across different projects.

## 🛠 Recommended Workflow

To achieve the best results and maintain organized projects, it is recommended to follow the configuration hierarchy of the toolchain:

### 1. Game Profile (Global Defaults)
The JSON files in the `games/` directory should define the **baseline standards** for your project. This includes engine-specific limits and the general "look" of the lighting that should apply to all maps in that game. 

### 2. Worldspawn (Map-Specific Setup)
The **Worldspawn entity** should be used to define map-specific lighting and surface treatments. Any key set in the Worldspawn (e.g., `samplesize`, `ambient`, `shading`, `radiosity`,  `deluxe`) will override the defaults in the game profile. This allows each map to have its own unique atmospheric character without changing the compiler's global configuration.

### 3. CLI Arguments (Build Modifiers)
Command-line arguments should be treated as **build-specific modifiers**. Use them to toggle between "fast" development builds and "high-quality" final bakes. For example:
- **Dev Build:** Use `-fast` or a larger `-samplesize` via CLI to get quick feedback.
- **Final Build:** Use `-upscale` or smaller `-samplesize` to maximize fidelity for the release version.

By following this hierarchy, your map source files (`.map`) remain portable and consistent, while you retain the flexibility to control the compile-time/quality tradeoff on a per-build basis.

## 🎨 Shader Modifications

List of additions and modifications made to shader parsing and features compared to the original q3map.

### New Shader Directives
- **q3map_vertexcolor <R G B>**: Overrides the vertex color for the surface.
- **q3map_surfacelight_glow <value>**: Sets the backface glow fraction for surface lights (enabled by default in CONTENTS_LAVA and CONTENTS_SLIME).
- **q3map_lightColor <R G B>**: Alias for `q3map_lightRGB`. Sets the light emission color for the surface.

### Color Handling
- **Global Application:** The new color processing pipeline applies globally. It works for shader commands (e.g., `q3map_lightRGB`, `q3map_lightColor`, `q3map_vertexcolor`) as well as entity keys (e.g., `color`, `_color`).
- **Format Autodetection:** The compiler automatically detects and parses colors provided in three formats:
  - Standard floating-point RGB (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Integer RGB (0 to 255)
  - Hexadecimal color codes (e.g., `#RRGGBB`)
- **No Color Normalization:** The compiler no longer automatically normalizes color vectors. The color values you specify are used exactly as intended, preserving the original brightness and artistic intent rather than artificially brightening the light emission.

### General Changes
- **Default Backsplash:** The default light backsplash is now disabled (0.0) unless explicitly requested by the game profile, via the `q3map_backsplash` directive or the entity key 'backsplash'.

### Stage / Pass Directives
- **material <image>**: Scanned inside rendering passes. This QFusion-specific keyword is recognized and its image will be used as a fallback to derive average surface colors and light colors if `qer_editorimage` or `q3map_lightimage` are not specified.

### Surface Parameters (`surfaceparm <parameter>`)
- **nosolid**: Acts as an alias for `nonsolid`. Clears the solid flag from the surface.
- **nowalljump** [to be moved to custominfoparms]: Disables wall jumping on this surface (specifically for the QFusion engine).

## 📦 Entity Keys Reference

> **Note on Underscore Prefixes:** This compiler ignores single underscore prefixes (`_`) on entity keys. For example, using `_color` is treated exactly the same as `color`, and `_shading` is treated the same as `shading`. This allows mappers to use standard Quake 3 convention keys interchangeably with our new parameters.
