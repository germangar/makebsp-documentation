## 💡 Key Features

### 1. High-Performance Ray Tracing (Intel Embree)
The legacy BSP-traversal ray caster has been replaced with the industry-standard **Intel Embree 4.4.0** BVH builder and intersection kernels.
- **Unified Data Cache:** To maximize performance, the toolchain pre-calculates and caches the world-space origin and normal of every lightmap texel and volumetric voxel. This cached geometry is shared across all lighting stages (Direct, Radiosity, and Ambient), eliminating redundant coordinate reconstruction.
- **Intelligent Light Culling:** The tool uses an advanced culling system that calculates a light's physical "reach" based on energy intensity and a configurable `cutoff` threshold. This allows the ray tracer to ignore surfaces outside a light's influence radius with zero overhead.
- **Performance Gain:** The combination of Intel's highly optimized BVH kernels and our internal geometric caching results in a 10x performance gain during the ray tracing phase compared to traditional tools.

### 2. 32-bit Floating Point Pipeline
- **Internal Buffers:** All lighting data (luxels, light grid) is accumulated in float32 buffers to prevent rounding artifacts and light clipping.
- **Dynamic Normalization:** Final 8-bit output conversion is deferred allowing for superior tonemapping and highlight compression.

### 3. Improved Model Support (misc_model)
`misc_model` entities are no longer second class citizens. They are fully integrated into the world geometry.
- **Omnidirectional Lightmapping:** Triangle soups receive high-quality, seamless lightmaps. The UV-to-world rasterizer preserves the integrity of the mesh regardless of its topology.
- **Automatic Collision (HACD):** Every model placed into the map is solid by default. Optimized convex collision hulls are automatically generated using the **HACD (Hierarchical Approximate Convex Decomposition)** algorithm.
- **Solid and Lightmapped by Default:** Unless explicitly disabled in the shader, all models are solid and lightmapped just like world brushes.
- **Modelgroups:** `misc_model`s can be part of `func_*` entities through them, bundling their visuals and collision seamlessly.
- **Supported Formats:**:
    - **Wavefront:** `.obj` (+ `.mtl`)
    - **Autodesk:** `.fbx`, `.ase`
    - **glTF:** `.gltf`, `.glb`
    - **Quake:** `.md3`, `.md5`
    - **LightWave:** `.lwo`
    - **Inter-Quake Model:** `.iqm`

### 4. Automatic Edge Chamfering
A highly requested feature that visually rounds the sharp edges of structural and detail brushes, creating a bevel effect.
- **Natural Highlights:** Prevents the classic "razor sharp" look of early 3D engines and naturally catches specular highlights on corners.
- **Deep Control Hierarchy:** Chamfer width and concave/convex joint separation can be controlled globally via CLI or JSON profiles, overridden per-material in `.shader` files, or finely tuned on a per-entity basis using entity keys.
- **T-Junction Preservation:** Integrates perfectly with the engine's T-junction fixing logic to guarantee watertight, crack-free meshes even after subdivision and corner contraction.
- **Geometry Optimization (Trisoup Conversion):** As a byproduct of the chamfering pass, fragmented planar surfaces are automatically promoted and merged into larger, continuous triangle soups. This significantly reduces draw calls and ensures seamless lightmap filtering across complex brushwork that would otherwise be split into hundreds of individual surfaces.

### 5. Deluxe Mapping V2
An improved, irradiance-preserving deluxe mapping system.
- **Iterative Accumulation:** Light directions are resolved during each contribution, preventing "rim bloom" artifacts[1] and ensuring stable directional highlights even in areas with opposing light sources.
- [1] It's not possible to fully eliminate them. They're part of the nature of deluxemapping, but they happen less often and the smooth filter can hide them when they happen.

### 6. Macro Ambient Occlusion (MAO)
A new volumetric ambient occlusion pass computes spatial "openness" for both the light grid and lightmaps.
- **Atmospheric Depth:** Large-scale features (caves, corridors, plazas) naturally darken or brighten based on their enclosure, grounding objects in the environment without requiring thousands of point lights.
- **Bent Normals:** Per-texel ambient energy includes a directional hint (Bent Normal), ensuring normal maps respond correctly to the primary direction of incoming ambient light.

### 7. Brush-to-Light Generation (func_light)
The `func_light` entity allows mappers to create complex light setups directly from brush geometry without any shader scripting.
- **Surface & Spot Lights:** Any brush surface can be instantly turned into an emissive light source or a spotlight emitter.
- **Ease of Use:** Mappers can control light intensity, color, and attenuation directly via entity keys, making high-quality emissive lighting accessible without modifying assets.


### 8. In-Editor Configurable Surface Colors
Mappers can now tint and recolor materials directly within the map editor without having to author duplicate shader files (the shader must have been created for this purpose, tho).
- **Entity Level Tinting:** By applying the `vertexcolor` key to entities like `misc_model` or `func_group`, the compiler automatically overrides the vertex colors of all associated surfaces.
- **Workflow Efficiency:** This allows for rapid iteration and material reuse. For example, a single "car" model or "crate" brushwork group can be placed multiple times in a map, each tinted a different color exclusively via entity keys.


### 9. Modernized Color & Lighting Models
- **Global Color Pipeline:** A unified color parser supports floating-point RGB (0..1), integer RGB (0..255), and Hexadecimal codes (`#RRGGBB`).
- **Artistic Integrity:** The compiler no longer automatically normalizes light colors. This preserves the original brightness and "mood" intended by the mapper.
- **Advanced Shading Models:** Support for industry-standard attenuation models (Inverse-Square, Unreal, Smoothstep) and shading kernels (Half-Lambert, Quadratic).

### 10. High-Quality 2D Filtering
Post-process lightmap filtering has been rebuilt for maximum quality and seamlessness across geometry charts.
- **Stitch Filtering:** The toolchain automatically identifies adjacent surfaces sharing world-space edges (partners) and performs cross-surface bilinear sampling to eliminate visible seams.
- **Volumetric Filtering:** Specialized world-space filtering for complex "triangle soup" (models) ensures smooth lighting gradients even on meshes with disconnected UV islands.
- **Kitbashing (Smooth Groups):** Mappers can group disjoint or intersecting `misc_model` entities using the `smoothgroup` key, blending their volumetric lightmaps as if they were a single continuous mesh.
- **Per-Surface Customization:** Mappers can override the global smoothing settings on a per-entity basis using the `smooth` key, allowing for sharper shadows on some objects and softer, more diffuse lighting on others.
- **GPU Acceleration:** All filtering and anti-aliasing passes are fully GPU-accelerated via OpenCL, allowing for high-quality multi-pass smoothing without significant compile-time penalties.

### 11. Customizable Game Profiles (JSON)
Externalized game-specific configurations into customizable JSON profiles.
- **Engine Adaptability:** Mappers can easily define new profiles for different game engines, specifying unique BSP versions, lump counts, and hard limits (max verts/indexes).
- **Global Defaults:** Every lighting parameter—including default lightmap sizes, shading models, and attenuation curves—can be tuned per game profile to ensure consistent results across different projects.

### 12. Automatic Light Halos
Spotlights and directed light sources can now automatically generate volumetric "halos" (billboards) to simulate atmospheric scattering.
- **Dynamic Sizing:** Halo dimensions are automatically calculated based on the light's intensity and radius, ensuring the visual effect matches the physical light cone.
- **Shader Control:** Mappers can override the default halo effect using the `haloshader` key or disable it entirely for specific lights. The halo size can also be controlled with the `haloscale` key.
- **Vertex Color Integration:** Halos inherit their color from the light source.

## 🛠 Recommended Workflow

To achieve the best results and maintain organized projects, it is recommended to follow the configuration hierarchy of the toolchain:

### 1. Game Profile (Global Defaults)
The JSON files in the `makebspdata/` directory should define the **baseline standards** for your project. This includes engine-specific limits and the general "look" of the lighting that should apply to all maps in that game. 

### 2. Worldspawn (Map-Specific Setup)
The **Worldspawn entity** should be used to define map-specific lighting and surface treatments. Any key set in the Worldspawn (e.g., `samplesize`, `ambient`, `shading`, `radiosity`,  `deluxe`) will override the defaults in the game profile. This allows each map to have its own unique atmospheric character without changing the compiler's global configuration.

### 3. CLI Arguments (Build Modifiers)
Command-line arguments should be treated as **build-specific modifiers**. Use them to toggle between "fast" development builds and "high-quality" final bakes. For example:
- **Dev Build:** Use `-fast` (which ignores high-resolution lightmap requests in `makebsp` and forces fast rasterized voxelization in `makelight`) or a larger `-samplesize` via CLI to get quick feedback.
- **Final Build:** Use `-upscale` or smaller `-samplesize` to maximize fidelity for the release version.

By following this hierarchy, your map source files (`.map`) remain portable and consistent, while you retain the flexibility to control the compile-time/quality tradeoff on a per-build basis.

> **A Note on Sky Shaders and Lighting**<br>
> It is **highly recommended not to configure lighting directly inside your sky shaders** (e.g., using `q3map_surfacelight` or `q3map_sun`). 
> - **Ambient Overlap:** The tool automatically calculates directional ambient irradiance from surfaces exposed to the sky (via the `ambient_sky` worldspawn key). If your sky shader also emits surface light, these two systems will overlap and blow out your lighting.
> - **Sun Entities:** For sunlight, use a standard `light` entity and set the `sun` key to `1` (or add `-sun` to the entity name/class depending on your editor's setup). This produces the exact same result as a shader-based sun but allows you to control the sun's direction, color, and intensity on a per-map basis without needing to duplicate and modify shader files for every new map.

---

## ⚙️ Game Profiles (makebspdata)

The compiler uses a flexible, data-driven profile system powered by `.json` files located in the `makebspdata/` directory. By default, the compiler provides two core profiles: `qfusion.json` and `quake3.json`. 

You can load a specific game profile at compile time using the `-game <name>` CLI argument.

### 1. Atomic Overrides (Sparse Loading)
The game profile parser is designed around **atomic loading**. When a `.json` profile is loaded, the compiler establishes the default QFusion settings in memory as a baseline. 

If your `.json` file only contains a few keys (e.g., just `"flareShader": "my_flare"`), the compiler will safely load your specific overrides while keeping all other default settings intact. A game profile does not need to list every single property to be valid.

### 2. Profile Inheritance (`"template"`)
To maximize modularity, profiles can inherit from one another using the `"template"` key. 
If your profile specifies `"template": "quake3"`, the compiler will automatically pause, load the entire `quake3.json` profile to establish a new baseline, and *then* apply your profile's specific keys on top.

```json
{
  "game": "my_mod",
  "template": "quake3",
  "bspVersion": 47,
  "flareShader": "textures/my_mod/custom_flare"
}
```
*Note: The compiler has built-in infinite loop protection. If two profiles try to inherit each other in a circle, the compiler will cleanly break the loop (at a depth of 4) and throw a warning.*

### 3. Custom Surface Parameters (`customSurfaceParms`)
The compiler no longer relies strictly on hardcoded C arrays for surface flags. Modders can inject custom engine-specific `surfaceparm` flags directly into the compiler through the game profile!

These parameters will be automatically recognized by the shader parser and mapped into the BSP surfaces.

```json
  "customSurfaceParms": [
    { "name": "nowalljump", "clearSolid": false, "surfaceFlags": "0x400000", "contentFlags": 0 },
    { "name": "forcefield", "clearSolid": true,  "surfaceFlags": 0, "contentFlags": "0x40000" }
  ]
```
- **Base Support**: Supports both standard decimal integers (e.g. `4194304`) and hexadecimal strings (e.g. `"0x400000"`) for bit flags.
- **clearSolid**: If set to `true`, surfaces using this parameter will have the `CONTENTS_SOLID` flag automatically stripped from them.

## 🎨 Shader Modifications

List of additions and modifications made to shader parsing and features compared to the original q3map.

### New Shader Directives
- **q3map_vertexcolor <R G B>**: Overrides the vertex color for the surface.
- **q3map_surfacelight_glow <value>**: Sets the backface glow fraction for surface lights (enabled by default in CONTENTS_LAVA and CONTENTS_SLIME).
- **q3map_surfacelight_cutoff <value>**: Minimum energy threshold before the surface light is completely culled.
- **q3map_surfacelight_fadeout <value>**: Percentage of the surface light's reach to use for a softness fade at the cutoff (0.0 to 1.0).
- **q3map_surfacelight_nodeluxe**: Prevents the surface light from influencing the deluxe map's directionality. Instead it will only contribute color/energy (to prevent bumpmap distortions caused by trim lights).
- **q3map_backsplash_nodeluxe**: Prevents the surface light's backsplash from influencing the deluxe map's directionality.
- **q3map_deluxe_minangle <value>**: Alias: `q3map_deluxeminangle`. Overrides the minimum incidence angle threshold (in degrees, 0.0 to 89.0) for deluxemap directionality on this material. Useful for softening or clamping deluxemap angles on specific surfaces without changing global defaults.
- **q3map_lightColor <R G B>**: Alias for `q3map_lightRGB`. Sets the light emission color for the surface.
- **q3map_maxsamplesize <value>**: Enforces a minimum lightmap resolution (quality floor) by establishing a maximum limit on the surface's `samplesize` value. Ignored during `-fast` compilations.
- **q3map_minsmooth <value>**: Enforces a minimum lightmap smooth filter radius. It only acts if the global setting has a smaller smooth value than the requested minimum. Can be overridden by an entity's `smooth` key.
- **q3map_chamfer_convexwidth <value>**: Overrides the width of the chamfered strip generated on convex edges for this material.
- **q3map_chamfer_concavewidth <value>**: Overrides the width of the chamfered strip generated on concave (inner) joints for this material. Set to 0 to disable concave chamfering.

### Color Handling
- **Global Application:** The new color processing pipeline applies globally. It works for shader commands (e.g., `q3map_lightRGB`, `q3map_lightColor`, `q3map_vertexcolor`) as well as entity keys (e.g., `color`, `_color`).
- **Format Autodetection:** The compiler automatically detects and parses colors provided in three formats:
  - Standard floating-point RGB (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Integer RGB (0 to 255)
  - Hexadecimal color codes (e.g., `#RRGGBB`)
- **No Color Normalization:** The compiler no longer automatically normalizes color vectors. The color values you specify are used exactly as intended, preserving the original brightness and artistic intent rather than artificially brightening the light emission.

### General Changes
- **Default Backsplash:** The default light backsplash for surface lights is now disabled (0.0) unless explicitly requested by the game profile, via the `q3map_backsplash` directive or the entity key 'backsplash'. Backsplash is enabled by default for spotlights.

### Stage / Pass Directives
- **material <image>**: Scanned inside rendering passes. This QFusion-specific keyword is recognized and its image will be used as a fallback to derive average surface colors and light colors if `qer_editorimage` or `q3map_lightimage` are not specified.

### Surface Parameters (`surfaceparm <parameter>`)
- **nosolid**: Acts as an alias for `nonsolid`. Clears the solid flag from the surface.
- **nowalljump** [to be moved to custominfoparms]: Disables wall jumping on this surface (specifically for the QFusion engine).

## 📦 Entity Keys Reference

> **Note on Underscore Prefixes:** This compiler ignores single underscore prefixes (`_`) on entity keys. For example, using `_color` is treated exactly the same as `color`, and `_shading` is treated the same as `shading`. This allows mappers to use standard Quake 3 convention keys interchangeably with our new parameters.

- **chamfer_convexwidth**: To do (Currently inactive because brushes are converted to a trisoup prior to the chamfering pass).
- **chamfer_concavewidth**: To do (Currently inactive because brushes are converted to a trisoup prior to the chamfering pass).

### Entity: func_trim

An iterative plane-trimming CSG operator for `misc_model` entities. It uses the drawable planes of its brushes to slice and trim away portions of any intersecting `misc_model` (turning standard brushes into an invisible cutting tool). The entity and its brushes are completely suppressed from the final BSP.

- **nudge**: Distance to nudge the generated light entities away from the brush surfaces. Defaults to 1.0 for spotlights (ignored for surface lights).
- **light**: The emission strength or intensity of the light.
- **color**: The color of the light. If not specified, it will attempt to derive it from the surface texture (lightimage).
- **backsplash**: Backsplash percentage for surface lights and spotlights (how much light bounces back). Default: surface 0.0/spot 0.1.
- **grid_ambientscale**: Multiplier for this light's contribution to the volumetric ambient light grid. Default 1.0. Set to 0 to skip grid ambient contribution.
- **grid_directscale**: Multiplier for this light's contribution to the volumetric direct light grid. Default 1.0. Set to 0 to skip grid direct contribution.

### Entity: _decal

Projects a 2D surface (defined by patches or brushes) onto map geometry. This is a classic q3map2 feature.
- **Surface Types**: Can be casted on all surface types (brushes, patches, and `misc_model`s).
- **Limitations**: Distance alphablending is not supported.

**Keys**
- **target**: Target entity name used to determine the projection direction and bounds. If omitted, the decal projects straight down.
- **decalgroup**: If specified, this decal will *only* project onto brushes, patches, and models that share the exact same `decalgroup` key. For brushes and patches, the key must be applied to the `func_group` they belong to.
- **patchSubdivision**: Adjusts the resolution of the decal when projected onto curved patches. The default is 0.4. Lowering this value (e.g. down to 0.1) increases the triangle density for a smoother curve, while higher values (e.g. 1.0 or 4.0) reduce the triangle count.

### Entity: misc_decal

A point entity that projects a 2D quad decal onto map geometry without requiring in-map brush or patch geometry as the projection source. The quad is centered at the entity's origin and faces opposite to the projection direction.

- **Projection Direction**: Determined by the `angles` key, or by targeting another entity (such as a `target_position`) via the `target` key. If neither is specified, it projects in the direction defined by the `angles` key (defaulting to the +X axis, or "East", if angles are zero/not set). To project straight down, set the Pitch to `90`.
- **Targeting / Groups**: Multiple `misc_decal` entities can safely target the same target entity (e.g. `target_position`) without conflict.

**Keys**
- **shader**: The shader to project (e.g., `textures/decals/logo`). Required; defaults to `textures/common/nodraw` with a warning if omitted.
- **width**: The width of the projecting quad source in game units. If omitted, defaults to the shader's image width multiplied by `0.25` (or `64` if the image size cannot be resolved).
- **height**: The height of the projecting quad source in game units. If omitted, defaults to the shader's image height multiplied by `0.25` (or `64` if the image size cannot be resolved).
- **scale**: A multiplier applied to the final width and height of the decal. Useful for scaling decals proportionally without calculating the absolute dimensions. Default: `1.0`.
- **distance** / **depth**: The projection depth/distance in game units. Default: `64`.
- **angles**: Rotation angles (Pitch Yaw Roll) that define the projection direction if no `target` is set.
- **rotate**: An angle (in degrees) to rotate the projected decal clockwise around the projection axis. Particularly useful for spinning the decal when pointing at a target entity.
- **target**: Target entity name used to determine the projection direction. If specified, the projection vector points from the `misc_decal` towards the target entity.
- **decalgroup**: If specified, this decal will *only* project onto brushes, patches, and models that share the exact same `decalgroup` key.
- **vertexcolor**: If specified, overwrites the vertex lighting of the generated decal geometry with a flat custom color (format: `R G B` or hex `#RRGGBB`).

## 💻 CLI Command Reference

### Makebsp CLI
Makebsp is the primary tool for BSP compilation, visibility calculation, and utility tasks.

**BSP Compilation (Default Mode)**
Used to compile a `.map` file into a `.bsp` file.
*New or relevant to makebsp:*
- `-game <G>`: Load a specific game profile (e.g., quake3, qfusion) from `makebspdata/<G>.json`.
- `-samplesize <N>`: Sets the default lightmap sample size (e.g., 4, 8, 16). Lower values = higher resolution.
- `-lightmapimagesize <N>`: Forces a specific lightmap atlas size (e.g., 1024).
- `-enforceSampleSize <0|1>`: If enabled (1), strictly follows the sample size defined in shaders or globally, forcing subdivision if necessary.
- `-guessuvs`: [Experimental] Automatically calculates optimal UV packing resolution for triangle soup (models) before repacking.
- `-noautocaulk`: Disables early automatic face caulking (by default, makebsp automatically strips and caulks redundant coplanar, contained, or fully submerged faces before BSP construction).
- `-rootdir / -basepath / -fs_basepath <P>`: Set the engine root directory path. Can be specified multiple times to build layered search paths.
- `-userdir / -fs_homepath <P>`: Set the user/home directory path (where the compiled BSP will be written). Can be specified multiple times.
- `-gamedir / -fs_game <P>`: Set the active mod/game directory name. Can be specified multiple times.
